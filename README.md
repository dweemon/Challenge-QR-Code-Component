## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned the importance of positioning while maintaining the flow of the page. I also learned how even the slightest font size change or margin, can greatly affect the entire layout of the page if you're not careful.


```css
.heading {
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 21px;
    font-weight: 700;
    margin: 5px 25px;

}
```



### Continued development

I would like to increase my understanding of flexbox and grid so I can use each of them comfortably in the right scenario. Positioning is another concept I would like to continue to develop so I'm able to map exactly what I have in my head onto my page.
